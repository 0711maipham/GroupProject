            <p>We are STD, the amazingly infectious trio you can't seem to get rid of! We're not exactly sure when we formed but you KNOW we're here to stay! Once you've let STD into your life, there's no turning back. The trio consists of 3 people: Sam, Tonette, and Drew. Although you may meet us one at a time, once you've met one of us, the other two will probably show up soon! We stick together like that.</p>
            <p>We also love Samuel L Jackson, especially in Pulp Fiction because, who doesn't love Sam Jackson? Plus, he has th esame name as one of the creators of this site! You just can't go wrong.</p>
            <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>
